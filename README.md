# NET-RMSI_Srv_Py

NET-RMSI_Srv_Py is the serverside application for the NET-RMSI project

Written in Python deriving from the Windows build developed in C#, allows for the software to run on a larger variety of hardware. The main purpose of this program is to provide a controller client such as a webserver or desktop client, the ability to control the [NET-RMSI_Client](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Client) attached to specific servers or hardware without physical access.


Documentation for NET-RMSI_Srv_Py can be in the [Wiki](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Srv_Py/wiki) section of this repo.

Branch layout is as follows:
* dev - Current WIP version of the software where new features are added often in stages, therefore making dev unsuitable for production.
* main - Current stable version of the software.
* version-x.x.x - Current bleeding-edge version of the software, along with legacy versions and codebases.
