# NET-RMSI_Srv_Py

NET-RMSI_Srv_Py is the serverside application for the NET-RMSI project

Written in Python deriving from the Windows build developed in C#, allows for the software to run on a larger variety of hardware. The main purpose of this program is to provide a controller client such as a webserver or desktop client, the ability to control the [NET-RMSI_Client](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Client) attached to specific servers or hardware without physical access.


Documentation for NET-RMSI_Srv_Py can be in the [Wiki](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Srv_Py/wiki) section of this repository.

***

Branch layout is as follows:
* [dev](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Srv_Py/tree/dev/) - Development branch, features are added often in stages and are not always fully functional as they get worked on, therefore making dev unsuitable for production.
* [stable](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Srv_Py/tree/stable/) - Current stable version of the software.
* [bleeding-edge](https://github.com/NET-RMSI/NET-RMSI_Srv_Py/tree/bleeding-edge/) - Newest features with full functionality but may contain bugs.
* version-x.x.x - Legacy versions and codebases.
